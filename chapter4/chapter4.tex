\chapter{MOJITOO Experiments \& Results }
\label{chapter:MOJITOO_bench}

\graphicspath{{chapter4/figs}}
In the previous chapter, we introduced our computational approach, MOJITOO, for the integration of single-cell multimodal data. Here, we outline the experimental framework employed in this thesis to validate our method and subsequently present the results. The framework comprises two sections: technical validation and biological validation. In technical validation (Section 4.1.1), the primary objective is to assess the performance of our approach and compare it to other methods. Moving to biological validation (Section 4.1.2), we apply MOJITOO to the \texttt{PBMC-Multiome} data generated from mouse Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells(PBMC). We test its capability to integrate each canonical component (CC) of the data and its effectiveness in identifying top genes and peaks associated with each CC to gain insights into the data.

In Section 4.2, we present the results described in Section 4.1. Specifically, in 4.2.1, we showcase the technical validation by comparing clustering accuracy, distance accuracy, and space preservation among competing methods. Additionally, we provide a comparison of computational resources, highlighting the efficiency of these methods. Next, we will introduce (in Section 4.2.2) the biological validation to demonstrate the effectiveness of MOJITOO in PBMC data. We conclude this chapter with a final discussion of our experimental workflow and the results in Section 4.3.


\section{Experiments}
\label{MOJITOO:exp}
In this section, we outline the experimental framework. We begin by introducing the single-cell multimodal data used in the benchmarking (Section 4.1.1). Following that, we delve into the specifics of executing eight computational single-cell integration approaches (Section 4.1.2). Subsequently, we present the technical evaluation of the competing methods (Section 4.1.3). Moving on, we showcase the biological inspection (Section 4.1.4). Finally, we provide a list of the statistical methods employed (Section 4.1.5).

\subsection{Multimodal benchmarking data}
\label{MOJITOO:exp:bench}
We utilize publicly available multimodal datasets with two or three modalities in our evaluation. The initial two datasets consist of single-cell CITE-seq data, capturing single-cell RNA and surface proteins simultaneously. The third and fourth datasets involve single-cell data measuring both single-cell RNA and single-cell ATAC simultaneously. Lastly, the last two datasets encompass single-cell data that simultaneously measure single RNA, single-cell ATAC-seq, and single-cell protein. \tref{tab:MOJITOO_DATA} summarize the detail of these data.

\end{table}


\begin{description}
	\item[{\texttt{BM-CITE}}]
	The human bone marrow mononuclear cells ({\texttt{BM-CITE}}) data set contains full transcriptomes and 25 surface proteins for over 30,672 cells annotated in 27 cell types~\citep{hao2021seurat4}. This data was obtained with the ``LoadData("bmcite")'' command from the package SeuratData. 

	\item[{\texttt{LUNG-CITE}}]
	The \texttt{LUNG-CITE} is derived from CITE-seq protocol which uses the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the lung ({\texttt{LUNG-CITE}}) ~\citep{buus2021improving} with 52 surface proteins. It contains 10,470 cells annotated in 22 cell types. This data was obtained from ~\url{https://tinyurl.com/253jp4sa}.

	\item[{\texttt{PBMC-multiome}}]
  	The data set contains human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({\texttt{PBMC-multiome}}) generated by the 10x multiome technology to measure gene expression (scRNA-seq) and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) on the same cells. This data contains 11,787 cells with 13 cell types annotated by 10X Genomics.  We use the scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq count matrices as provided by 10x genomics after processing with the Cellranger pipeline obtained from the ~\url{https://tinyurl.com/yw229pbf}.

	\item[{\texttt{PBMC-multiome}}]
	The data set is based on the SHARE-seq protocol measuring gene expression and chromatin accessibility of mouse skin cells ({\texttt{ SKIN-SHARE}})~\citep{ma2020chromatin}. This data contains 34,774 cells, which are annotated as 23 cell types. We obtain the skin scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq counts and fragments files from the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number (\href{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE140203}{GSE140203}).

	\item[{\texttt{PBMC-DOGMA}}]
	This tri-modal data set of human PBMCs is measured with the DOGMA-seq protocol~\citep{mimitou2021scalable}. This provides RNA, ATAC and epitope sequencing of the same cells ({\texttt{PBMC-DOGMA}}). We use data under low-loss lysis conditions containing 13,763 cells in 27 cell types. We download count matrices as provided by the authors ~\url{https://osf.io/6kr4v/}.

	\item[{\texttt{PBMC-TEA}}]
	The tri-modal dataset is based on human PBMCs measured with the TEA-seq protocol~\citep{swanson2021simultaneous}. It contains transcripts, epitopes and chromatin accessibility of 25,517 PBMCs grouped into 12 cell types ({\texttt{PBMC-TEA}}). For this data set, we obtain original matrices and combine data from distinct wells from GEO (GSE158013). As this scATAC-seq lacks uniform peaks, we create an integrated matrix by combining peaks, allowing an extension of 250 bps. Ultimately, we intersect all barcodes from scRNA-seq, protein, and scATAC-seq to obtain matrices in the same cellular space.
\end{description}

BM-CITE---Next, we applied the ~\hyperref[sec:preproccessing]{pre-processing} pipeline.	
For scATAC-seq, we obtain an integrated matrix by combing peaks (allowing an extension of Â±250bps). We finally intersect all barcodes from scRNA-seq, protein and scATAC-seq to obtain matrices in the same cell space. Characteristics of each of the six data sets are described in ~\tref{tab:MOJITOO_DATA}.

\subsection{Execution of single cell multi-modal integration data}
\label{MOJITOO:exp:run}
% List how to install and run the competing methods

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}
\label{MOJITOO:exp:preprocessing}
We initiate a standardized pre-processing pipeline for all previous datasets, commencing from their count matrices. The specifics of the pre-processing steps for individual modality data are outlined, with additional steps described for a dataset requiring batch correction.
\begin{description}
    \item[scRNA-seq data]
    We follow the standard Seurat 4 pipeline (\href{https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html}{source}). Initially, we log normalize the data using the NormalizeData function with default parameters. Subsequently, we identify the top 3000 variable features through FindVariableFeatures and perform data scaling using ScaleData. Finally, we employ RunPCA to conduct dimension reduction~\citep{hao2021integrated}, retaining the first 50 principal components.
    
    \item[scATAC-seq data]
    We adhere to the standard pipeline outlined in the \href{https://satijalab.org/signac/articles/pbmc_vignette.html}{Signac} documentation~\citep{signac}. This involves applying TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) on the peaks, running RunSVD on the top features obtained from the FindTopFeatures function with min.cutoff=`q0' parameter, resulting in an LSI dimension-reduced matrix. We retain the first 50 dimensions, excluding the first dimension due to its high correlation with the number of fragments.  
    
    \item[Protein data]
    We adopt the standard Seurat 4 \href{https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/multimodal_vignette.html}{pipeline}\citep{hao2021integrated}. In summary, we use NormalizeData with parameters normalization.method = `CLR' and margin = 2, followed by ScaleData and RunPCA with 30 PCs using default parameters.
    
    \item[Additional step] 
    \texttt{PBMC-DOGMA} is the only data set evaluated here with two biological conditions (stimulated and unstimulated). To address the presence of batch, we employ Harmony integration\citep{korsunsky2019harmony} independently for RNA-seq and epitope data, integrating control and stimulated samples. For scATAC-seq, integration is carried out by disregarding the first LSI dimension, highly correlated with the stimulation. \afref{fig:batch_correction} illustrates MOJITOO results both with and without batch correction.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Competing methods}
%% TODO: need split these into two parts: algorithm(chapter2) and execution(chapter4).
\begin{description}
    \item[MOFA] 
    We obtained MOFA2 (version 1.2.2)\citep{tewari2017mofa} from \href{https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2}{https://github.com/bioFAM/MOFA2} and installed it using the command `R CMD INSTALL MOFA2'. Subsequently, we executed MOFA with default parameters and followed their recommendations in the tutorial \url{https://raw.githack.com/bioFAM/MOFA2_tutorials/master/R_tutorials/10x_scRNA_scATAC.html} for analyzing all the data. However, we now provide PCA/LSI reductions as input for MOFA, as this has improved its computational time (Appendix ~\atref{tab:time}), as well as the clustering performance in MOFA's latent space\afref{fig:MOFA}.
    
    \item[Schema]
    We installed Schema (version 0.1.5.3)~\cite{singh2021schema} using the command `pip install schema\_learn' in the python==3.9.6 environment. Schema has its exclusive pre-processing and dimension reduction steps, so we retained these steps for multimodal data and performed the integration with default parameters as per their tutorial available at \url{https://schema-multimodal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/recipes/index.html}.
    
    \item[Seurat4 WNN]
    We installed Seurat (version 4.3.0) using `remotes::install\_version(``Seurat", version = ``4.3.0")' in the R (version 4.1.0) prompt. Subsequently, we executed WNN, an integral part of Seurat 4, using default parameters. 
    
    \item[scAI]
    We installed scAI(1.0.0) using `devtools::install\_github(``sqjin/scAI'')' in the R prompt. We execute scAI in only bi-modal with RNA and ATAC-seq datasets with default parameters according to their tutorial example \url{https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sqjin/scAI/blob/master/examples/walkthrough_simulation.html}.
    
    \item[LIGER]
    We install LIGER~\cite{kriebel2021nonnegative} new version rliger(1.0.0) using `R install.packages(``rliger'')' in the R prompt. LIGER~\cite{kriebel2021nonnegative} can perform integration, whenever there is some overlap between the features across modalities (shared features), i.e. protein and RNA expression of the same gene or gene accessibility scores for ATAC-seq. LIGER estimates a gene accessibility (ATAC-seq) matrix by counting the total number of ATAC-seq reads within the gene body and promoter regions(3kb upstream) for each gene per cell. An additional unshared feature matrix is further produced by binning the genome into bins of 100,000 bps and counting the overlap of these bins with peaks from the respective data set. Regions associated with ENCODE Blacklist regions~\cite{amemiya2019encode} are removed, see in detail\citep{liu2020jointly}. To note, LIGER can be only executed for bi-modal data sets. We run LIGER according to their tutorial \url{http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/welch-lab/liger/blob/master/vignettes/UINMF_vignette.html}. Since LIGER only provides latent spaces for each modality without a unified space, we simply combine the dimensions from the two modalities to obtain a shared space.
    
    \item[Symphony Integration]
    The CCA analysis is not part of Symphony~\cite{kang2021symphony} source code, we implemented it based on a script provided by authors (\url{https://github.com/immunogenomics/TB_Tcell_CITEseq/blob/main/R/cca_analysis.R}). Also, due to high computational requirements, we were only able to run this on the dimension-reduced space (PCA/LSI) described above. We call this method Symph-Int to reflect the fact that this is not Symphony, but an integration method used in one of the analyses of Symphony manuscript. 
    
    \item[DIABLO]
    We installed mixOmics (version 6.16.3), which includes the implementation of DIABLO~\cite{singh2019diablo}, using Bioconductor with the command BiocManager::install("mixOmics") in the R prompt. DIABLO integrates multiple data sets in a supervised way and was originally designed for bulk multi-omics data, where sample labels are available and explored for feature selection. Since labels are not available for the single-cell multi-modal data evaluated here, we provide a distinct label for each cell. DIABLO is executed as indicated in their tutorial \url{{http://mixomics.org/mixdiablo/}}. Due to prohibitive computational costs if raw matrices are used, we provide dimension-reduced matrices as input. Another major parameter is the number of CC components, which is usually set to the number of classes minus 1, but this is too large for single-cell data. Here, we used 30 components. Additionally, DIABLO does not provide a common latent space. Therefore, we used the same strategy to combine latent spaces as for MOJITOO.

\subsection{Evaluation of multi-modal integration Methods}
\label{MOJITOO:exp:metrics}
We describe single cell multi-modal for technical validation.

	\vspace{0.1cm}
	\caption[MOJITOO evaluation workflow]{
	\textbf{MOJITOO evaluation workflow.} \textbf{A)} We input 6 single-cell multimodal datasets. Subsequently, we carry out pre-processing using standard pipelines from Seurat and Signac, followed by dimensional reduction. Harmony batch correction is applied to data \texttt{PMBC-TEA}, \texttt{BM-CITE}, and \texttt{LUNG-CITE} due to their batches. Integration methods are then executed to obtain the shared latent space. The evaluation of Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) requires clustering in the range from 0.1 to 2.0 with a step of 0.1. Silhouette score and Structure score are also utilized for benchmarking. \textbf{B)} We utilize the largest dataset, \texttt{Skin-SHARE}, to measure time consumption and memory usage for each competing method. Initially, we downsample the data from 30,000 cells to 3,000 with a step of 3,000 to obtain 10 different dataset sizes. Subsequently, all methods are executed to measure the time elapsed and peak memory usage.}

\begin{description} %%formula
	\item[Space Presevation] The high-dimensional space preserves of each dataset can be calculated as the Pearson correlation between all pairwise distances in the high-dimensional spaces and the corresponding distances in the original space~\citep{jain2021multimap}. For multimodal data, space-preserved scores can be obtained for each modality, and these individual scores are then averaged to derive the final space-preserved score.
	\item[Distance Accuracy]. 
  silhouette to latent space to evaluate the performance of these methods. For each data point $i\in C_i$, where $C_i$ is the label of the data point, we calculate the inner cluster mean distance:
\begin{equation}
  a(i) = \frac{1}{|C_i| - 1} \underset{j \in c_i, i\neq j}{\sum} d(i, j)
\end{equation}
Next, the smallest mean out cluster distance to data point $i$ is:
\begin{equation}
b(i) = \underset{k\neq i}{\min}\frac{1}{|C_k|}\underset{j\in c_k}{\sum} d(i,j)
\end{equation}
The solhoutte index is defined as:
\begin{equation}
s(i)=\frac{b(i)-a(i)}{\max\{a(i), b(i)\}}, -1\leq s(i) \leq 1
\end{equation}
where $d(i,j)$ is the distance of two cells under some specific latent space, here we considered both euclidean distance and cosine distance.

	\item[Clustering Accuracy] Clustering Accuracy measure the clustering accuracy compared to the true labels using different integrated embeddings. In comparing the clustering outcomes with labels from benchmarking datasets, we employed the adjusted rand index (ARI)\citep{hubert1985ARI}. This index assesses the similarity between two clustering results by accounting for the likelihood of randomly grouping elements. Specifically, given a dataset $D$ with $n$ cells, two partitions $ X = \{ X_{1}, X_{2}, \cdots X_{r} \} $ and $ Y = \{ Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \cdots, Y_{s} \} $ denoting different clustering results, the number of common cells for each cluster $i$ and $j$ can be written as $n_{ij} = X_{i} \cap Y_{j} |$, where $ i \in \{1, 2, \cdots, r \} $ and $ j \in \{1, 2, \cdots, s \} $. Then Adjusted Rand Index(ARI) is denoted as follows:
	\begin{equation}
		ARI = \frac{\sum_{ij} {n_{ij} \choose 2} - [ \sum_{i} {a_{i} \choose 2} \sum_{j} {b_{j} \choose 2 } ] / {n \choose 2}}{\frac{1}{2} [\sum_{i} {a_{i} \choose 2 } + \sum_{j} {b_{j} \choose 2}] - [\sum_{i} {a_{i} \choose 2} \sum_{j} {b_{j} \choose 2 } ] / {n \choose 2} }
	\end{equation}
	where $ a_{i} = \sum_{j=1}^{s} n_{ij} $ and $ b_{j} = \sum_{i=1}^{r} n_{ij} $ respectively. The ARI ranges from a minimum value of 0, denoting random agreement between two data clusterings, to a maximum value of 1, indicating identical clustering results.  To be fair, we perform Louvain clustering with varying resolution (parameter from 0.1 to 2.0 with step=0.1) to estimate the adjusted Rand index. 
	\item[Requirements of Memory and Running Time] We also compare the peak memory usage and running time to check the effectiveness of these methods. For this, we inspect the time and memory used in the largest datasets in our benchmark (SKIN-SHARE). To obtain curves, we down-sample the number of cells from 30,000 to 3,000.
